    *All inputs on this page feed into the `lib/utils/data/values/CommentValues.dart` values.*
    - `data` - The main data entry page where users input details for autonomous, teleoperated, and endgame phases. Its fields and labels are organized into separate subdirectories.
    *All inputs on this page feed into the `lib/utils/data/values/AutonomousValues.dart`, `lib/utils/data/values/TeleoperatedValues.dart`, and `lib/utils/data/values/EndgameValues.dart` values.*
    - `prematch` - Contains fields for initials, match number, and team number, and automatically selects the team based on the match number and driver station configured in the settings.
    *All inputs on this page feed into the `lib/utils/data/values/PrematchValues.dart` values.*
    - `qrcode` - Contains routes for scanning QR codes and managing related data for creating or saving them.
    - `settings` - Provides the settings route where users configure event ID, team number editability, and other important settings for app functionality.
    *All inputs on this page feed into the `lib/utils/data/values/SettingValues.dart` values.*

        - `constants` - Holds fixed values such as dropdown options, app details (name, URIs, event codes), and other immutable app settings.
        - `values` - Stores dynamic values that change based on user input, with controllers ensuring app-wide synchronization during a session.
    - `helpers` - Includes methods to assist with file creation, UI adjustments like brightness, and functions like QR code scanning and generation.

### Automatic Team Number Assigning
The scouting platform uses a system which combs through a generated match schedule with a custom-made schedule generator.

#### Schedule Format
The schedule that is generated by the custom schedule generator is in the following format:
```
match_number,red1,red2,red3,blue1,blue2,blue3
1,1114,1113,1112,1111,1110,1109
2,2056,2055,2054,2053,2052,2051
...,...,...,...,...,...,...
```

#### Using a Generated Schedule
Using a generated schedule, automatically assigning team numbers based on the selected driver station and match number is simple. Follow these steps to use a schedule:

1. Generate a match schedule with a file name that follows the app's naming convention: `match_schedule_[event_id].csv`, where `[event_id]` is replaced by the ID of the event you're scouting. Place this file in the device's documents directory.
2. Ensure the schedule has the correct team IDs in the proper order. You can verify this by checking the first three matches and comparing them to The Blue Alliance data.
3. In the `lib/utils/data/constants/AppConstants.dart` file, locate the default event ID configurations. It's good practice to update the `defaultEventID` to the current event ID, ensuring the app grabs the correct schedule. Although this value can be modified and saved between sessions, updating the `defaultEventID` helps avoid errors. Additionally, update the `defaultFileName` value to match the CSV file name generated after scanning.
4. Test the automatic team number assignment by navigating to the settings, verifying the event ID (or updating it if necessary), selecting your desired driver station, and then heading to the prematch data route. Enter a match number, and the app should automatically resolve the team number based on your driver station and match number.

### Modifying Generated Spreadsheet
To modify the generated spreadsheets values and columns is made simple.

#### Spreadsheet Column Configuration
All columns for the spreadsheet are configured in the `lib/utils/helpers/ScanningHelper.dart` file under the `csvColumnNames` value. The column names will appear from left to right following the array from top to bottom. <br/>
*Note: When modifying the values in this array, please keep in mind that it will shift the indexes of either up or down depending on your operation. This is important to note when adding the values to the spreadsheet.*

#### QR Code Value Configuration
When removing or adding values to the QR code or the spreadshet, you can modify the values in the `lib/utils/helpers/QRCodeHelper.dart` file. Beside each value you can find an index number comment, this is the order that each value appears in the spreadsheet when it scans and the order it appears in for the QR code. Please keep in mind that these values will shift indexes in the QR code and the spreadsheet when a value is removed or added.

### QR Code Encoding
The QR code is not currently readable meaning that the values are not stored in plain text. To reduce issues with unicode characters the data is encoded with base64 on the way in to the QR code and is decoded by the scanner on the way out to the spreadsheet. You can decode the values going into the QR code by using a free online too such as https://www.base64decode.org/ to decode the base64 data.

### Input Field Examples
Examples of how to use the base input field widgets with basic functionality. For more information on more complex configurations, please see the base file you wish to configure.

#### Counter Number Field
A field that has an increment and decrement button on either side of the value you're changing displayed. This is used heavily for tracking scoring of game pieces.
```
CounterNumberField(
    controller: ValuesFile.valueToChange,
    onTapDecrement: () =>
        decrementNumber(ValuesFile.valueToChange),
    onTapIncrement: () =>
        incrementNumber(ValuesFile.valueToChange))
```
`ValuesFile`: The name of the file that contains the value you wish to control via the counter number field.
`valueToChange`: The value name in the `ValuesFile` you wish to control via the counter number field.
`decrementNumber` and `incrementNumber`: Custom methods that check the value of the `valueToChange` and either adds or removes 1 with the `setState` function.

#### Number Input Field
A field that allows the user to type any number in a field. This is similar to a text input field, but only allows the user to type numbers in the field.
```
NumberInputField(
    onChanged: (value) {},
    controller: ValuesFile.valueToChange,
    hintText: "Example Field",
)
```
`ValuesFile`: The name of the file that contains the value you wish to control via the number input field.
`valueToChange`: The value name in the `ValuesFile` you wish to control via the number input field.

#### Platform Dropdown Menu
A dropdown menu that is custom made to be flexible and to come pre-packaged with basic configurations. Used mainly for endgame related states or yes or no dropdowns.
```
PlatformDropdownMenu(
    dropdownMenuSelectedItem: ValuesFile.valueToChange.text,
    onChanged: (value) {
        setState(() {
            ValuesFile.valueToChange.text = value;
        });
    },
    dropdownItems: OptionConstants.yesNoOptions
)
```
`ValuesFile`: The name of the file that contains the value you wish to control via the dropdown menu.
`valueToChange`: The value name in the `ValuesFile` you wish to control via the dropdown menu.
`OptionConstants.yesNoOptions`: An array of strings that can be selected in the dropdown. This example shows an example of the yes or no options to create a simple yes or no dropdown.

#### Stopwatch Button (DEPRECATED)
Allows the user to record time for something like a hang or endgame phase. A single tap can start or start the stopwatch and a double tap will reset the time.
```
StopwatchButton(
    value: ValuesFile.stopwatchTime,
    state: ValuesFile.stopwatchState,
    timer: ValuesFile.stopwatchInstance,
)
```
`ValuesFile`: The name of the file that contains the value you wish to control via the stopwatch.
`stopwatchTime`: The text editing controller used to hold the time recorded by the stopwatch.
`stopwatchState`: The text editing controller used to hold the number state of the stopwatch (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3)
`stopwatchInstance`: The stopwatch instance that holds and manages the values of the stopwatch.

#### Text Input Field
A commonly used field in the comments phase of the user experience. This allows the user to type any text characters, with the exception that all unicode characters are stripped when encoded into the QR code.
```
TextInputField(
    controller: ValuesFile.valueToChange
    onChanged: (value) {},
    hintText: "Example Field"
)
```
`ValuesFile`: The name of the file that contains the value you wish to control via the text input field.
`valueToChange`: The value name in the `ValuesFile` you wish to control via the text input field.

## Schedule Generator
We use a custom-built [Schedule Generator](https://github.com/Simbotics/Scouting-Platform-Schedule-Generator) to generate schedule for [automatic team number assigning](#automatic-team-number-assigning). You can find all documentation and help in the repository.
